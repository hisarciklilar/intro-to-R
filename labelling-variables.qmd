# Labeling Variables

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(wooldridge)
data("hprice2")
```

There are alternative packages which could be used to label variables. We will be using the `Hmisc` package. Remember to install this package and call the library by running the code below (without the `#`):

```{r}
# install.packages("Hmisc") # to label variables
library(Hmisc)
```

We are ready to label our variables:

```{r}
# label variables
label(hprice2$price) <- "Median housing price, $"
label(hprice2$crime) <- "Crimes committed per capita"
label(hprice2$nox) <- "Nitrogen Oxide in the air, in parts per million"
label(hprice2$stratio) <- "Average student-teacher ratio of schools in the community"
label(hprice2$rooms) <- "Average number of rooms in houses in the community"
```
