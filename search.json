    "text": "1.1 R, R Studio and Quarto\nR is a very powerful statistical software that is becoming increasingly popular. Being able to do data analysis using R will very likely increase your employability.\nWarning: R is not like other apps that you have used! It requires coding. You will need to practice regularly. There will be a lot of struggle, but the result is worth it.\nWe list below the apps that you will need to work with during the sessions. You may install these on your computers. Alternatively, you may use Coventry University’s Appsanywhere platform to get access. But you will find working with the app easier if it is locally installed.\nRStudio has four main windows, that often have more than just one purpose. Figure 1.1 provides a brief description of each RStudio window. We will use all of them during the sessions, but the most important ones will be the console and the editor pane.",

R is freely available for Linux, MacOS and Windows. Please download the version that matches your computer’s operating system.\nTo facilitate your work with R, we highly recommend to download and install the integrated development environment (IDE) RStudio Desktop from posit. This platform will make it easier for you to write and run R code.\nA final package that we highly recommend you to install is a publishing system, Quarto. You may use Quarto to produce documents in various formats (such as HTML, MS Word, PDF, PowerPoint, etc) while integrating your R code and output. You will easily have the option to change the format of your output as you desire. We will be using Quarto to produce documents in the third session of the series. Please visit Quarto for further information and download.\n\nOnce you download Quarto, you will have access to it through RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: RStudio windows and their functions",

So for example, Introduction-to-R may be the name of the folder and then you may have sub-folders such as data, R-scripts, etc.\nIf you are using the computers in the lab, it may be best if you create a folder on your OneDrive account as you can easily access this at home and on-campus.\nBefore working on the data, set your working directory. R will save all files in there and, if you want to open a dataset, R will also look in there first. Select the folder you have created for R workshops.\nUse setwd(the_address_you_would_like_to_locate_your_work) in the console to choose your work directory. You may alternatively do this through the menu:\n\nSession –&gt; Set Working Directory –&gt; Choose Directory\nYou will see the console printing this action, which may help you to remember how to use the console next time.\n\nIf you are unsure of in which folder your work is, type getwd() in the console and R will print the current location you are at.",

    "section": "2.2 Storing information in objects",
    "text": "2.2 Storing information in objects\nR lets you save data by storing it inside an R object. An object is a name that you can use to call up stored data.\n\na &lt;- 5\n\na\n\n[1] 5\n\n\n\na + 2\n\n[1] 7\n\n\nIn the example above, we store value of 5 under object a. We then call the value stored under a and sum it with 2.\nNote the use of &lt; together with - . This representation (&lt;-) resembles a backward pointing arrow, and it assigns the value 2 to the object a.\n\nb_vector &lt;- 1:6\nb_vector\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nIn the above example, we create a vector, whose elements are numbers from 1 to 6 and store it under b_vector.\nWhen you create an object, the object will appear in the environment pane of RStudio (on the top right-hand-side of the R screen). This pane will show you all of the objects you’ve created since opening RStudio.\n\n2.2.1 Naming of objects\nNote the following;\n\nAn object name cannot start with a number (for example, 2var or 2_var)\nA name cannot use some special symbols, like ^, !, $, @, +, -, /, or * . You may use _\nR is case-sensitive, so name and Name will refer to different objects\nR will overwrite any previous information stored in an object without asking your confirmation. So, be careful while making changes.\nYou can see which object names you have already used by calling the function ls:\n\nls()\n\n[1] \"a\"        \"b_vector\"\n\n## [1] \"a\"        \"b_vector\"\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Naming conventions\nYou may see the following styles for naming of variables:\n\nCamel case\n\nCamel case variable naming is common in Javascipt. However, it is considered as bad practise in R. Try to avoid this kind of naming.\n\nbankAccount = 100\n\n\nUse of dots\n\ndot is used in variable names by many R users. However, try to avoid this too because base R uses dots in function names (contrib.url()) and class names (data.frame). Avoiding dot in your variable names will help you avoid confusion, particularly in the initial stages of your learning!\n\nbank.account = 100\n\n\nSnake case\n\nUse of snake case is considered to be good practice. Try to follow this approach.\n\nbank_account = 100\n\nNote that you may find different users of R having a preference towards different styles. The recommendations above are from the “Tidyverse style guide”, which is available from https://style.tidyverse.org.\nStart your variable names with a lower case and reserve the capital letter start for function names!\n\n\n2.2.3 Removing objects\nYou will see that the Environment window can quickly get over-crowded while working interactively. You may remove the objects that you no longer need. by rm(object_name )\n\nrm(a)\n\nIf you have too many objects piled up and you would like to remove them all, then you may type rm(list = ls()). This will fully clear your environment.\n\nrm(list = ls())\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Example of using variables\nLet us calculate the module mark for a student who got 65% from coursework and 53% from exam. The weights for the coursework and exam are, respectively, 25% and 75%.\n\n# let's calculate module mark for a student\ncoursework &lt;- 65\nexam &lt;- 53\nmodule_mark &lt;- coursework * 0.25 + exam * 0.75\n\nprint(module_mark)\n\n[1] 56",

    "section": "",
    "text": "We may use the mean() function to find the average value of a variable. For example, below, we find the average housing price:\n\n\n# Calculate the average price\nmean(hprice2$price)\n\n[1] 22511.51\n\n\n\nSimilarly median() function could be used to find the median.\n\n\n# Calculate the median price\nmedian(hprice2$price)\n\n[1] 21200\n\n\n\nUse sd() for standard deviation\n\n\n# Calculate the standard deviation of price\nsd(hprice2$price)\n\n[1] 9208.856\n\n\nYou may wonder why we add hprice2$ in front of every variable. The reason is that R can store more than one data frame, matrix, list, vector etc., at the same time, so the prefix hprice2$ is necessary to avoid ambiguity and ensure that we are working with variables in the hprice2 data. Think of hprice2$ as an address where e.g. the variable price stays. If you have loaded another data frame that contains a price variable, R would know that we want to use the variable from the hprice2 data set and not from the other data frame. There are library packages that can facilitate the process, however, these are beyond the scope of this workshop.\nIn addition to mean and median, we may be interested with the minimum and maximum values.

For the moment, below are a few examples of what we can do with base R (with base R, we refer to the operations of R that could be done without installing or calling additional libraries).\nScatter plot\nWe may use scatter plots to depict the relationship between two variables. In the example below, we are depicting the relationship between housing price and crime. You may read the ~ between the two variables as approximated by. So here, price is approximated by crime.\n\n# scatterplot showing the relationship between price and crimes \nplot(hprice2$price ~ hprice2$crime)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may add more informative titles to our axes and also provide a general title for the plot:\n\n# scatterplot showing the relationship between price and crimes \nplot(hprice2$price ~ hprice2$crime, \n     xlab = \"Crimes committed per capita\", \n     ylab = \"Median housing price, $\", \n     main = \"Negative effect of crime on housing price\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, there is a negative relationship between the crime rates in a location and the median house prices in that location.\nIn the following pages, we will be estimating regresions to model the houseing price with a set of independent variables. Before moving on to regression analysis, it is good practice to get to know our dependent variable. A histogram will reveal its distribution.\nHistogram\nBelow, we provide histograms of price and lprice (logarithmic price). Which one should we use in our regression?\n\n# Histogram of price and logarithmic price\nhist(hprice2$price, \n     xlab = \"Median housing price, $\", \n     main = \"Histogram of median housing price, $\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(hprice2$lprice, \n     xlab = \"Logarithm of median housing price, $\", \n     main = \"Logarithm of median housing price, $\")",
