# Hello! This is R!

-   R is a very powerful statistical software that is becoming increasingly popular.

-   Being able to do data analysis using R will very likely increase your employability.

# Advantages of Using R

-   People with diverse range of interests use R in data analysis.
    -   There are many resources to explore!
    -   Easy to find packages ready to use for that complex analysis you are after!
    -   Easy to collaborate when everybody uses the same programme
-   Replicability of analysis
-   Steep learning curve, but you will reap the benefit soon

# R and RStudio

-   We will be using **R** as the statistical analysis tool. It is freely available for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

-   To facilitate our work with R, we use an integrated development environment (IDE) **RStudio Desktop.**

-   You may install these on your computers. Alternatively, you may use Coventry University's [Appsanywhere platform](https://appsanywhere.coventry.ac.uk/) to get access. But you will find working with the app easier if it is locally installed.

# R and RStudio

-   We use RStudio to work with R.

-   You may think of R as the engine that runs the car and RStudio as the panel, which facilitates user's instructions.

# R can get moody!

-   It is not menu-based. You will need to write a code for almost everything you do.
-   It is case sensitive. You need to be very careful with the use of lower case and capital letters
-   Similarly, you need to be very careful with
    -   what information to put where,
    -   where to (or where not to) use commas, brackets, or quotation marks.

# A warning . . .

-   The path is full of frustration
-   You will need to be patient and put a lot of effort

BUT...

-   Remember that a simple Google search will hit a lot of relevant answers to your question. You are not alone!
-   Do not feel like you need to memorise everything. Try to understand the basics and the logic of R and its libraries

# Let's begin coding!

-   Create a folder in your computer for this workshop. This folder should include all material you download from [shared OneDrive folder](2025.03%20--%20Introduction%20to%20R%20Software).

-   Group files in sub-folders in a way that you can locate them easily. So for example, `Introduction-to-R` may be the name of the folder and then you may have sub-folders such as `data`, `R-scripts`, etc.

-   If you are using the computers in the lab, it may be best if you create a folder on your OneDrive account as you can easily access this at home and on-campus.

# R packages / libraries

-   R comes with a basic set of operations

-   It has a very wide group of users who contribute with user-written packages/libraries for specific calculations

-   One can install and call these packages easily

-   There are multiple ways of doing the same thing in R, through different libraries.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```
